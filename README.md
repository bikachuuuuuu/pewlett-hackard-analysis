# pewlett-hackard-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

## Results

Upon analysis of the data provided by Pewlett-Hackard, we retrieved the number of employees who are retiring, and sorted by position title.

The number of employees retiring per position title.
After pulling the number of employees who are retiring, sorted by position title, we investigated mentorship eligibility in the company. Our parameters were employees who are currently employed with Pewlett-Hackard, and born in 1965.

After conducting the analysis it was found that there is currently a large number of employees of retirement age holding senior titles (57,668/90,398 = 64%) with around 64% of the staff to retire.

The number of employees eligible for the mentorship program, per position title.
Reviewing these two lists, there are a number of conclusions we can draw.

The largest number of positions being vacated via retirement are the Senior Engineers and the Senior Staff. These are more than 20,000 employees each.
Comparing the number to those eligible for the mentorship program, the numbers are much smaller. There are no positions where more than 1,000 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

We can also see that there are no employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program for the position of manager.
To address the large gap of eligible employees to the retirement-ready employees, Pewlett-Hackard may want to look into expanding their eligibility requirements for the program, and/or begin the process of hiring more employees for those positions.

## Summary

At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are getting ready for retirement or being redirected to their mentorship initiatives, which will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
